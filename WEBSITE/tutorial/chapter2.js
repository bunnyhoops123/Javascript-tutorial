//A variable is container for storing data
//A variable behaves as if it was the vlaue it contains 

//Two steps:
//1. Declaration( var, let, const)
//2. Assignment (= )

let age;
age =10; //number //Can be done in single step as well
let firstName = 'Sumukh'; //String
let student = true;//Boolean 

age  = age +1;


//Experiment with adding two string variables
console.log("hello" + firstName);//Example of string concatenation
console.log("You are " + age + " years old.")


console.log(age);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(student);
